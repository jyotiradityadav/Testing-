| Community support        | Large, active                    | Large, active                   |
| Development speed        | Fast, due to pre-defined classes | Fast, due to scoped styles      |

### Recommendations

- **Tailwind CSS** is recommended for projects needing rapid development and highly customizable designs.
- **styled-components** is ideal for React projects requiring scoped styles and component-based architecture.

## New Animation Libraries

### Overview

Recent advancements in animation libraries have focused on performance, ease of use, and integration with modern frameworks. Notable libraries include:

- **Framer Motion**: A React library for animations and gestures, offering simple syntax and powerful features.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: A robust JavaScript library for high-performance animations, suitable for complex sequences.
- **Lottie**: A library for rendering animations exported from Adobe After Effects, providing high-quality vector animations.
